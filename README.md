### NEH Project title
Language-instruction software is becoming an increasingly important tool for language learners.  However, many insights from classroom language teaching have not been incorporated.  Our previous research shows that teachers’ gestures are a useful guide for language learners.  For example, when learning the long/short vowel contrast in Japanese (e.g., kare means “boyfriend”, while karee means “curry”), instructors aid students by clapping once for short vowels and twice for long vowels. While the benefits of these gestures are known for in-classroom instruction, their applicability to software-based language learning has not been demonstrated; we propose to test whether this effect holds when software avatars recreate instructors’ gestures. We expect students who learn from a gesturing avatar will outperform students who learn from a non-gesturing avatar on pronunciation tasks. Further, the use of an eye-tracker will allow us to determine the level and location of learners’ attention.

### Data management plan

####Data storage and preservation of access
All the data will be stored in GitHub, Google Drive, iDVL lab server where it will be maintained by project team members. Backups will occur on external hard disks periodically (at least four times a year). The data will be permanently archived at the iDVL server, Texas Tech University (TTU) repository (ThinkTech), Google Drive and GitHub along with the external hard disks. The iDVL server is an online server which is maintained by the iDVL lab under the supervision of co-PI Tommy Dang. ThinkTech is an online publishing and archival service for the TTU community which is managed by TTU libraries. ThinkTech provides an opportunity for scholars to archive and distribute their work without any content and format limitation. Final reports and publications will be deposited in ThinkTech. The TTU libraries will be responsible for the long-term management and maintainance of these assets.
