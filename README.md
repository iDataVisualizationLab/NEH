# NEH Project title
Language-instruction software is becoming an increasingly important tool for language learners.  However, many insights from classroom language teaching have not been incorporated.  Our previous research shows that teachers’ gestures are a useful guide for language learners.  For example, when learning the long/short vowel contrast in Japanese (e.g., kare means “boyfriend”, while karee means “curry”), instructors aid students by clapping once for short vowels and twice for long vowels. While the benefits of these gestures are known for in-classroom instruction, their applicability to software-based language learning has not been demonstrated; we propose to test whether this effect holds when software avatars recreate instructors’ gestures. We expect students who learn from a gesturing avatar will outperform students who learn from a non-gesturing avatar on pronunciation tasks. Further, the use of an eye-tracker will allow us to determine the level and location of learners’ attention.
